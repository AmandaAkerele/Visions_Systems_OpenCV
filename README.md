I was wondering if CAD still reported different versions of the ED Wait Time indicator split by whether they were admitted or discharged home.  Do you think that those could serve as “segments”? 
If so, I’m hoping that your team might be interested in bringing this indicator into our second pilot?

2)	Still on the topic of ED Wait time indicators, we’re keen to understand the run time of an indicator written using python that’s accessing data from Hub and running in the OSSDS.  To have that sort of information could help our tech team make decisions that would enable us to target SLAs for how many indicators we can process concurrently, and how quickly they can run.  
Not sure whether any of the ED Wait time indicators have already been transitioned to python, but if so, I’m wondering if you might be willing to have one of your analysts work with us to attempt to run the code in the OSSDS against the new NACRS enriched file?
