Subject: Shallow-Slice Pilot Project Update: Automating Indicators for YHS Transition

Hello everyone,

I am pleased to share an update on the progress of our shallow-slice pilot project aimed at automating indicators for the YHS transition.

The shallow-slice pilot is a specialized data flow or data pipeline designed to process input files containing pre-calculated indicators and metrics. Our primary objective is to store this data exclusively for presentation on cihi.ca.

One of my main responsibilities in this project has been the development of Python code to generate indicator data in the prescribed shallow-slice format. This code is both robust and reusable, serving as a foundational tool that analysts can integrate with their dataframes to produce the desired outputs efficiently.

Our target is to publish these indicators using the shallow-slice approach by September 2024. To ensure the success of this project, I have worked closely with the team to establish several critical rules and guidelines:

1. **Suppression**: We are implementing rigorous data suppression protocols to effectively manage sensitive or irrelevant information, thereby maintaining data integrity and privacy.

2. **Transformation of CIHI's Public Data Products**: We are focused on improving the way CIHI reports its public data, with an emphasis on enhancing clarity and user-friendliness.

3. **Improving Visualizations**: I have been actively involved in refining the YHS In-Brief and YHS In-Depth visualizations to better meet the needs of our target audiences.

4. **Data Accessibility**: To facilitate ease of use and reference, we are co-locating relevant reporting information within our data sets.

In addition to these guidelines, I have been exploring opportunities to automate the calculation of specific indicators and contextual measures, aiming to significantly streamline our data processing workflow. As part of this initiative, I will be organizing training sessions to familiarize analysts with the tools, processes, and specifications required for manual data loading into the shallow-slice data pipeline.

In conclusion, the shallow-slice pilot project represents a significant advancement in our efforts to automate and optimize indicator reporting for the YHS transition. I encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with the tools and guidelines we've provided and to begin leveraging them in your respective roles.

Thank you for your attention, and I am open to any questions or feedback you may have.
