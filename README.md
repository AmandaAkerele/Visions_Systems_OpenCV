Good morning, everyone,

As we've discussed previously, I'd like to outline the challenges we've been encountering with the server, particularly within the OSSDS environment.

Frequently, while working, we've experienced issues with the kernel crashing. This disrupts our workflow significantly, as we are forced to reconnect to the server and start our data processes from scratch. This has severely impacted how we operate.

I've also noticed that in the past two weeks, the server seems to perform better during the evening and early morning hours, from 7 PM to 3 AM, as opposed to usual business hours.

Additionally, there have been instances where my environment was mistakenly mapped to another team's shared folder. This error prevented me from accessing the CAD environment and caused delays in getting to my team's folders.

Overall, the environment has been quite unstable lately. We are hopeful that with the upcoming deployment, these issues will no longer persist moving forward.
