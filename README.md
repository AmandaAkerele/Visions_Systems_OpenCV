Good Morning All

As discussed I wanted to give a breakdown of the issues we have faced with the server


On frequest occasion will working the OSSDS environment 


We have faced issues with the kernel dying which has disrupted our work flow Therefore having to reconnect the server and starting from the beginning to run the data. This has massively interrupted the way we work. 

Also observed that the system that in the last 2 weeks the server has operated better in the evening/early hours of the morning (7pm â€“ 3am) when compared to the usual office hours. 

Environment being mapped to another teams sharedfolder. On 2 occasions, I have observed my environment being mapped to another teams folder (thereby not giving me access to the CAD environment which has also led to delays in accessing my teams folder)



Generally the environment has been unstable lately as we hope that with this new deployment we will not face this issues going forward.
