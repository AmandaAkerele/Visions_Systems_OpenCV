YHS transition project!
Currently working on the shallow-slice pilot project for the Indicator automation.

Shallow slice is a data flow (aka data pipeline) that accepts an input file containing pre-calculated indicator/metrics and stores the data solely for presentation on cihi.ca. 

have the responsibility to develop python code that create the indicator data in the prescribed format which is the shallow slice format. 
This program code that I have implemented can be used in the future by analyst. All you will have to do it plug your dataframe on the already pre-existing calculated indicator in using the code to generate the output. 

We are the Back-End development for the YHS Transition project 
Will work with indicator owners/analysts for code ingestion for 
indicators to be published in Sept 2024 using the shallow slice approach.
For the Inidicators, the code implementation had a lot more rules to adhered to for the Shallow Slice project. And when I speak about rules
A transformation of how Cihi reports its Public data products
•	Improve YHS In-Brief & YHS In-Depth visualizations to better meet the target audiences’ needs 
•	Ensure relevant reporting information is all co-located for easy use/reference 

Automate the calculation of some indicators or contextual measures
•	Learn about tools, process and specification for manual loading of  the data pipeline through Shallow Slice
•	Analysts can start creating indicator and contextual measure data for YHS Transition
