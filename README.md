Hello Everyone,

Previously, when using the pandas library for converting code from SAS to Python, we had a unified method for calculating percentiles. However, we currently lack a standardized approach across the company for percentile calculation using the Pyspark library. It would be beneficial to establish a percentile calculation method for Pyspark. I have drafted a brief code for percentile calculation using Pyspark, but I'm concerned there may be rounding issues. I am exploring alternative methods for percentile calculation with Pyspark.

Thank you.

Hello everyone,

During our previous work with the pandas library for code conversion from SAS to Python, we had a centralized approach for calculating percentiles. However, presently, we lack a centralized or company-wide method for calculating percentiles using the PySpark library. It would be beneficial to have a percentile calculation function for the PySpark library. Although I've developed a brief code snippet using PySpark for percentile calculation, I'm concerned about potential rounding issues. I am exploring alternative options for percentile calculation using PySpark.

Thank you.
