Certainly! Here's a rephrased version:

---

Yes, yesterday when I logged into the OSSDS environment to access the CAD shared folder, I realized that my environment was incorrectly mapped to another team's folder. As a result, I couldn't locate the CAD folder at any point during my sessions on the OSSDS VM. This mapping error, compounded by the ongoing connection issues with OSSDS, prevented me from accomplishing any work yesterday. I notified Mariam and the ATT Team about these issues, submitted a CIHInow ticket, and discussed it at our team meeting. I'm pleased to report that the issue has now been resolved.

However, I was unable to access the CAD shared folder during this time.
