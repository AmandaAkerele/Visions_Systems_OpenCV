I'd like to contribute to Marcus's email regarding the files. The GUD file containing the indicators is quite large and cannot be effectively handled using the Pandas Library in Python due to memory constraints. I also suspect that the DAD and NACRS Enriched file may be similarly large to the GUD File (please correct me if I'm mistaken). If the Enriched file is indeed as substantial as the GUD file, then pyspark would be the most suitable tool for handling it, given that Pandas may struggle with such large datasets due to memory limitations.s
