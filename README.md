Good Morning ,

Thank you for the positive feedback in my recent PMP evaluation. I appreciate the recognition of my commitment to quality, professionalism, and meeting job objectives. It's been rewarding to contribute to projects like the SAS code conversion to Python and updating with PySpark and GUD files, all while collaborating effectively with the team. I'm also glad to assist my colleagues through the internal study group. I look forward to continuing to contribute to our team's success and achieving our future goals together.

Best regards,
Amanda Akerele
