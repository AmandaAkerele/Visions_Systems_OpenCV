Good morning Amanda. Sara and I appreciated discussing with your team about OSS issues yesterday. I remember you said that in your previous organization, they used standard python packages to perform data analysis and if you don't mind, I'd like to know what was your previous organization. Not because I'm looking for another job () but rather because I thought yesterday's discussion about using standard packages was really interesting and I hope I can learn more about teh experience from organizations who decided to use standard packages.
