Subject: Request for Form T2200 for Home Office Expenses

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request the Form T2200 for the purpose of claiming home office expenses. I sincerely apologize for the delay in sending this request after the March 15th deadline. Being new to tax filing, I was unaware of this requirement earlier.

I would greatly appreciate it if my request could be accommodated to enable me to proceed with claiming the home office expenses.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Warm regards, 

[Your Name]
