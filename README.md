Subject: Re: Discussion on OSS Usage and Experiences

Good morning,

Thank you for the follow-up. At my previous company, we utilized the standard Pandas library extensively for various tasks, including logistic regression calculations and other data analyses. These standard codes were already integrated into the daily workflow for all staff, which streamlined our processes significantly.

I believe the challenges we are currently facing at CHI stem largely from still being in the migration phase. Once we finalize the standard codes we intend to utilize here, I anticipate a smoother workflow akin to what I experienced previously. For now, it's reasonable to expect these types of issues as we transition, but I'm confident we'll overcome them as we move forward.

Thank you once again for an engaging discussion, and I look forward to more fruitful collaborations as we advance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
