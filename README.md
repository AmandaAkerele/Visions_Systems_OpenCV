### What Went Well

- **Strong Team Support**: We received full support from the Digital Solutions Team and the ITS team, which was essential for our progress.

- **Leveraging Previous Experience**: Our prior work on the shallow slice pilot project provided a solid understanding of the automation process.

- **Knowledgeable Support Staff**: The support staff were highly knowledgeable and offered the necessary assistance to the team.

- **Building Confidence**: Throughout the project, analysts became more confident in accessing and capturing data within the environment, particularly when working with the newly introduced DAD & NACRS enriched data and org_dim table, despite the fast pace.

### Areas for Improvement

- **Project Timing and Preparation**: When the automation pilot project began, many team members were still preparing their indicator analyses. This caused delays in information flow as the team was focused on understanding the elements within the DAD & NACRS enriched files and the newly introduced oi/org_dim tables. It would have been beneficial to allocate more time for this understanding phase before starting the automation project.

- **GitLab Proficiency**: Some team members lacked experience with GitLab. During the automation period, some analysts had to take crash courses on the basic concepts of GitLab to work in the remote dev/uat environment. It would have been better if the team had received GitLab training prior to the project's commencement.
