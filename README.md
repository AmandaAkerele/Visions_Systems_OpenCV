8 years of expertise in business intelligence, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence,
I bring a strong track record of transforming complex data into actionable insights while adhering to industry
standards. Proficient in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, PowerBi, and ETL processes, I excel in defining ETL job
sequences, dependencies, and error handling procedures, streamlining workflows and managing technical debt
projects. My educational journey includes a Master’s Degree in Data Analytics, a Postgraduate Diploma in Artificial
Intelligence, and a BSc. Hons in Accounting and Finance. Moreover, I have actively collaborated with Data
Architects, interpreted intricate business requirements, and translated them into efficient ETL code. My proficiency
in cloud computing platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, coupled with expertise across data warehousing, data
integration, natural language processing (NLP), and data mining, underscores my versatility. I am poised to
contribute significantly to any organization's success, leading development teams, creating solution architectures,
conducting gap analyses, developing application frameworks, and ensuring successful design and delivery
engagements. Additionally, my experience in supporting and mentoring technical team members, along with my
familiarity with multiple operating system platforms, application frameworks, and tools, further enhances my ability
to provide maximum value as a Data Analyst. I also possess excellent communication and collaborative abilities,
which are essential for effective teamwork and project success.
