Hi All,

As we had previously while using the pandas library for the code conversion from SAS to python, we had a centralized calculation for calculating the percentiles. However, currently we donâ€™t have a centralized/company wide method of calculating the percentile using Pyspark library. Obtaining a percentile calculation for the pyspark library will be great. I have implemented a short code using pyspark for the percentil calculation but I do fear there by might some rounding issues. I am looking at other options for the percentile calculation using pyspark.
