Hi Team, 

I am sending this email to kindly request for the Form T2200. I do apologize that this is coming after the March 15th. As I am new to filling tax I didnâ€™t realize that this was a requirement. 
I Would appreciate if my request is granted to proceed with claiming the home office expenses.
